# Background
Safely Ltd. is a newly established business in the outskirts of Dublin, Republic of Ireland. The was founded by 2 friends who share common goal of making workplace a safe place. 

Pinky and Brain have vast experience in health and safety, risk assessment and management. Their previous employers were in need of a simple solution that help them record and keep track of any risks and inicidents that might happen in the workplace. As a project leads in finding such a software they have done extensive research in finding the perfect solution. 

Pinky and Brain decided to join their forces and share their researches with each other. They exchanged information and pros and cons of all tested solutions to speed up their work.

They both came to same conclusion that none of the apps available on the market could satisfy their needs. Many apps required expensive and extensive implementations, often overloaded with features that required hours of training. 

This insight gave them an idea to build their own app. They both work for a global companies that can afford to spend money and build something that will meet their needs. With that in mind both Pinky and Brain sold the idea to the board of directors and got funding to build the app and start a new venture.

# Target Audience
The app will be used by all employees in every department:
* office based teams

## Design Choices

### Fonts

Pinky and Brain have chosen Poppins fonts from Google Fonts library to be used throughout the project.

* Content & Headings - [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins "Poppins")

### Colors

Pinky and Brain have discussed various sets of colours and decided on a set of main colours that they want to be used for the project.

&nbsp;

![Colour Pallet](docs/designs/colour-palette.png)

&nbsp;

The colours will be used as described in the table below

| Hex Value | Root variable name | Text | Button | Background | Opposite Colour
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
| #FFFFFF | white | X | X | X | black, burgundy
| #000000 | black | X | X | X | white, pattens blue
| #E1F2F7 | azure | X | X | X | black, green
| #AE093B | burgundy | X | X | X | white
| #E5BACE | pink | X | X | X| black
| #004208 | green | X | X | X| white, azure

&nbsp;

All of the desired colour combinations have passed the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "WebAIM") and the results can be seen below.

| Foreground | Background | Results
| -- | -- | --
| black | pattens blue | [result](docs/designs/black-azure.png "result")
| black | pink | [result](docs/designs/black-pink.png "result")
| pattens blue | green | [result](docs/designs/azure-green.png "result")

| white | green | [result](docs/designs/white-green.png "result")
| black | white | [result](docs/designs/black-white.png "result")

### Images
The only requirement was to ensure that any images used in the app will correspond to the subject of safety, security, work hazards and risks.

## Future developments

There are a few ideas that I would like to implement in the future:
* Search function to find hazards by entering keywords
* Filter funciton to narrow down list based on the hazard type, riks level, status etc.
* Additional user profiles and access levels -> administrator, manager, employee
* Use Google maps location service when adding a new hazard
* Additional dropdown lists of 'Risk Types', 'Risk Probability', 'Risk Consequences'
* Risk level to be computed automatically depending on the 'Risk Type', 'Risk Probability' and 'Risk Consequences'
* Additional field to add 'Corrective Action' for each hazard recorded
* User's can be assigned to specific team within the company
* Hazard can be assigned to specific team to resolve
* Biometric login
* Automated email to notify manager, user or a team that the new hazard has been recoreded for them to resolve
* User profile picture
* Ability to inactivate users without deleting any data they recorded
* Accessing camera to snap an image of hazard right from the application

# Deployment

This project was created using [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub"), [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/ "Gitpod") and the code was written using [Micorsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The project was deployed to Heroku right from the start to anticipate any possible bugs and errors in early stages of the development. I controlled each deploymnet to Heroku and left automatic deployment option off. I used interchangeably two ways to deploy new piece of code to heroku:

* Via Visual Code Terminal
```
heroku login -i
Email: __enter_heroku_account_email__
Password: __enter_heroku_account_password__
heroku git:remote -a __your _heroku_app_name__
git push heroku main
```

* Via Heroku UIElements
```
Login to Heroku dashboard
Choose your own app
Choose 'Deploy' from the top menu bar
Scroll dowon to 'Manual deploy' section
Click 'Deploy Branch' button to deploy
```

## Local Deployment

As Gitpod was the IDE that was used to create the project, the following local deployment steps are specific to Gitpod.


### Cloudinary
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ "Cloudinary")
* Click on the *Sign Up For Free* button
* When the account is created, you should see the *API Environment variable*, we will need this for a later process.


### GitHub
* Visit [Github](https://github.com/ "Github")
* Create an account or log in


#### GitHub Desktop
* Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/lukaszkukla/safely "repository")
* Click on the *Code* button above the file list
* Select *Open with GitHub Desktop*

### Set up your Workspace
When you have your version of the original repository,

* In the terminal run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* In the root directory create a file called **env.py** and add the following content, the content of these, must match the Config Vars in the Heroku deployment section

```py
import os
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = "FROM HEROKU DEPLOYMENT SECTION, DATABASE_URL CONFIG VAR"
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = "FROM HEROKU DEPLOYMENT SECTION SECRET_KEY CONFIG VAR"
os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = "API ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE REMOVE 'CLOUDINARY_URL=' FROM BEGINING"
os.environ['DEVELOP'] = '1'
```

* Add the env.py file to the .gitignore file to ensure that its contents are not made public

* Migrate the database models with the following command in the terminal
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

* Create a superuser and set up the credentials with the following command
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

* Run the application locally with the command
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

* To access the admin page using the superuser details just created, add /admin to the end of the URL.

### Deployment via Heroku
